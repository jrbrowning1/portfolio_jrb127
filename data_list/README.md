### Impressions
I found this to be a very helpful project, but it definitely stretched me in trying to diagnose errors and such.
I really wanted to understand exactly what was going on at all times, but at parts it felt like I was 
just following a list of directions. When I have more time I plan to go back and examine some parts of this 
module more closely so I know exactly what is going on behind the hood.
