### Assignment Notes

Known Bugs:
Certain photos take longer to apply filter to than others

Extra credit (I took this to mean work past the prescribed minimum):
-Image filtering has many different levels of filter using the three different sliders 
for each of the RGB colors.
-More than one style based on just tag name
-More than one style based on class name applied to tag
-More than one style based on id applied to tag


### Impressions
I thought this was a great introduction to building a website. It certainly felt like taking on
a lot at once, but it was manageable with time. However, I had to be careful in working on this
because this is certainly a project that you can sink an unlimited amount of time into. It's not 
like other CS classes where there is a very specific set of test cases that you have to pass in 
order to be "done" with the assignment. Ultimately I enjoyed that; I just hope my understanding
of the specific requirements was complete enough to obtain the grade that I am aiming for. 
Overall, a good assignment, though I do wish things were slightly more ordered on the course
webpage so I didn't have to have several different pages open to get the full view of requirements
for the project.
