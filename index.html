  <h2>Welcome!</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to my homepage for my <a href="https://www2.cs.duke.edu/courses/spring21/compsci290/">CS 290: Web Application Development</a> 
    course at Duke University!
  </p>

  <h2>Who am I? (just the basics)</h2>
  <div class="prose">
    <p>
      I'm Jonathan and I'm from Lexington, KY - the horse capital of the world (except I'm not a big horse
      guy myself so if you ask about them, I won't have any answers). I'm a junior, set to graduate in the spring of 2022. 
    </p>

  <h2>From Poptropica to Duke: A Computer Science Journey</h2>

    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <div class="prose"> 
      <p>
        Looking back on it, I couldn't tell you when I first began using a computer. I can remember using them almost
        as far back as my memories go, but I know I didn't grow up totally surrounded by technology like kids these days 
        do. If I had to put a specific time on it, I would say I first began using a computer at the start of elementary school,
        mainly to play games like Poptropica or whatever was popular on Miniclip. My computer interests matured throughout 
        the few years after that, and it was in fourth grade when I first became interested in computer science (albeit a 
        very rudimentary version). I got involved with Lego Robotics and quickly fell in love with the programming aspect. For a 
        shy kid with glasses, there was something very empowering about being able to make a program that would precisely control
        a little robot. I continued with Lego Robotics through middle school (and in high school as an assistant coach) and took
        my first true computer science course as a freshman in high school. The rest (and to be fair, everything I already mentioned)
        is history.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3> Computing Experience</h3>
    <div class="prose">
      <p>
          Everything seems to be a computer these days, so I'll just give you the highlights. 
          I've used Windows computers, Macs, and some Linux (I thought it would be cool to dual boot my laptop with Ubuntu for a while). I 
          have an iPhone (that I use more than I would like to), as well as an iPad. I've used a number of different programming 
          langugaes (most of them through different school courses), including Java (my favorite - or at least my most used), C, Python, Scheme,
          a brief forray into MIPS, R, MATLAB (not my favorite), as well as a handful of others I've used briefly for
          a school projects. I use computers for what feels like basically everything outside of class. Programming on the other 
          hand, has been mostly limited to coursework and the occasional experimentation here and there. I plan on changing that. 
      </p>
  </div>

    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <div class="prose">
      <p>
          For months I've been telling myself I would learn some of the basics of web development, but never sufficiently motivated myself to jump in headfirst. I'm hoping this class will 
          force that jump and that, at the end of it, I will have the knowledge to finally make use of the domain name I bought months ago 
          (<a href="http://www.jonathanrbrowning.com/">www.jonathanrbrowning.com</a>). I see myself as using programming in at least some aspect 
          of my future career - I'm just not sure if I want it to be my entire career. I've become deeply interested in design (including user
          experience design, open design, and human-centered design) recently, as well as the education space at large; I suppose the ultimate goal
          would be figuring out how to combine my newer interests with software development. 
      </p>
  </div>

    <h3>(My guess about) The Life of a Web Developer</h3>
    <div class="prose">
      <p>
          I would assume that web developers work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on a regular basis. But I would also assume that 
          they don't just spend all day typing away, making minor tweaks to a website. Websites, unlike some other code, is 
          inherently human-facing, so there should be a strong human element in the web developer's day. Whether that's the boss talking 
          about new features they want, or a small-business client describing how they want their website to look depends on where the 
          developer works. Outside of the aforementioned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I don't really have a good idea of what's needed
          to code different parts of a website. If I was a betting man, I would bet that SQL is used in some respect for some of the databases
          that are behind the scenes of websites. 
      </p>

  <h2>Looking for inspiration (on building websites)</h2>

  <div class="prose">
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Websites I like</strong> 
      <ul>
        <li>The <a href="https://goduke.com/">Duke Athletics homepage</a> is one of several websites I frequent as a sportswriter for <a href="https://www.dukechronicle.com">The Chronicle</a>.
            The colors are sufficiently contrasting and it's easy to nagivate. The most recent news is front and center, and there's an easy to use taskbar 
            at the top whenever I want to look more depth at a certain sport. </li>
        <li>
          Much like their products, <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple's website</a> is visually pleasing and is intuitive to use. There's a 
          focus on images on the homepage, with enough links to other parts of the site to get you know where you need to go. There are splashes of 
          color, but nothing distracting to the eyes. While it would be a disservice to call Apple a "user experience company" when they're 
          revolutionzing consumer-grade ARM chips, a good deal of what makes them so appealing is the experience that comes from using their products,
          not just the end result you get. </li>
      </ul>  
    </li>

    <li> <strong>Websites that leave something to be desired</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <a href="https://drive.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Kentucky DMV</a> site (along with many other government sites) is one of my least
          favorites that I unfortunately had to frequent recently when renewing my license. It's not the ugliest site ever, but there's a 
          number of different colors that don't entirely go together, there's a plethora of links all over the main page, multiple search boxes 
          on the page, and overall, it's just confusing to navigate. Nothing about it screams "modern." </li>
        <li>For a website that I've been hearing my dad talk about since I was a kid, <a href="https://raleigh.craigslist.org/">Craiglist's</a> website
            is in sore need of an update. The colors aren't bad, but it's not intuitive to use at all. The homepage is inundated with links to 
            way too many different options. It looks like something that someone who just learned HTML would put together, not a company that's been
            around longer than I've been alive. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Tutorials</h2>

  <div class="prose">
    <ul>
      <li>
        One of the main issues of the digital age is the sheer number of logins that each individual has. To keep track of them all 
        and all the associated passwords, there have been two main options. 1) Use a password manager such as LastPass or 2) use the same
        password/variation of the same password for every site. The first option is a great one, but is difficult to get started with. However,
        SSO (Single Sign On), has made this much easier, allowing one account (Duke account, Google account, AppleID, etc) to log you into a 
        variety of different sites. I think implementing a feature like this into our websites could be super interesting - 
        <a href="https://codeburst.io/building-a-simple-single-sign-on-sso-server-and-solution-from-scratch-in-node-js-ea6ee5fdf340">this tutorial</a>
        provides a starting point for doing that.
      </li>
      <li>
        Another common issue of the digital age is an increasing risk of online security breaches. Other than having a strong password (and using a
        password manager), another good idea is two enable 2FA (two-factor authentication). If our websites are to handle any sensitive data, I would 
        consider 2FA an essential piece in implementing the site. <a href="https://learn.vonage.com/blog/2017/04/11/implement-two-factor-authentication-2fa-web-apps-node-js-dr/">
        This tutorial</a> may be able to help with that.
