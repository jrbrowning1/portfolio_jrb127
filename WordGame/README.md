### Impressions
I thought this was a good project for getting us more comfortable with coding in JavaScript. I 
personally struggled on picking which word game to try and program and I spent way too much
time trying to perfect the algorithm for one game before deciding to switch to something that I knew
I would be able to do and finish in the time I had.
