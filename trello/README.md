### Assignment Notes

Known Bugs:
-Drag and drop doesn't work perfectly
-Deadline considers "day of" late
-Copying, deleting, or otherwise editing card while filtering leads to unexpected results so i disabled it as i didnt have ample time to debug

Extra credit:
Ability to collapse certain things

### Impressions
This project has been a good way to get more comfortable with vue, bootstrap, and reactivity. However, it was a ton of work and there are a lot of little things that I would have loved to change and add, but I simply didn't have the time. I think this project should have had more time allotted to it. I feel like we got about the same amount (or maybe less) than we got for the quiz assignment, and this was a significantly more involved assignment than that one.
