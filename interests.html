        Growing up a Duke basketball fan, I developed a love for watching sports from a young age. As I got older, my tastes began to 
        branch outside of just Duke basketball and I started to enjoy other sports, including football and tennis (go Nadal). But despite 
        all the time I spent watching sports, I never  gave a second thought to writing about them. That changed when I got to Duke. 
        I went to a soccer game during my orientation week and was quickly hooked, realizing that there were so many other sports out 
        there I hadn't given a chance. The next semester I joined <a href="https://www.dukechronicle.com">The Chronicle's Sports Department</a> and have since written about a number of 
        sports. Included below are a few of my favorite articles and moments that I've had the opportunity to write about (to read the full 
        article, click on the picture). The complete selection of my articles can be found <a href="https://www.dukechronicle.com/search?a=1&o=date&au=jonathan+browning">
