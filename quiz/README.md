### Impressions
I thought this was a good assignment for getting started with Vue and I am very 
appreciative of the extension that was given across the board. I do think I probably
could have simplified some of my code further if I had a greater understanding of 
the Vue framework, as a good portion of my code for evaluating the chosen answers
was able to stay the same as the quiz exercise. Hopefully I will have the time to dive
more fully int Vue after this assignment, even if that dive doesn't result in me 
going back and simplifying this one further.
