### Assignment Notes

Known Bugs:
-Deadline considers "day of" (and sometimes the next day) late
-Copying, deleting, or otherwise editing card while filtering leads to unexpected results
-drag and drop wasn't working for moving entire columns so i removed the code that tried to implement it

Extra credit:
Ability to collapse certain things

### Impressions
This project has been great for helping me better understand how to break up a project into components. Though
I do think parts of this project would have been easier had we been introduced to this at the beginning of the 
trello assignment, rather than after we already had code that worked.
