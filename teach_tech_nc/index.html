    <h2>High Level Project Idea Description</h2>
    <p>
        This website is the built-out prototype of the work I did in my I&E 590 class: Special Topics
        in Innovation and Entrepreneurship. In this course, we have been focusing on improving high school education, with a 
        focus on technology education that revolves around the role of technology in society. In talking with a number of 
        teachers, many common themes came up, but two stood out: teachers believe that teaching about how technology impacts society
        is critical, but they don't have the time nor background to figure out how to incoporate these topics into an already 
        established curriculum and set of standards. 
        <br><br>
        That's where this website comes in. There's already a ton of good content 
        about these topics that lives out on the web, but there is no centralized location where teachers would be able to access it. 
        And, even more crucially, there's no other site out there linking that content to the education standards (particularly computer
        science ones). This site will provide that linkage. When teachers want to incorporate a tech in society topic, such as 
        algorithmic bias and the very real effects it can have on people's lives, rather than scouring the web for the content and then
        working it into a standard, they could instead come to this site where we would have already provided all that information for them,
        so they can spend more time focusing on their individual class. As of right now, much of the data is just examples of how it would
        look but, in the future (as I am going to continue working on this project), we will add more real data and resources. Because the 
        problem we're trying to solve can't be fixed by just filtering a lot of data from some other site; it has to be manually curated 
        by me (and hopefully others in the future).
    </p>

    <h2>High Level Project Implementation Description</h2>
    <p>
        The structure of my project is relatively simple. The website itself was built using Vue Router (regular settings, not history mode) so
        that different pages would actually have different paths. In the future when this site is relocated to the domain that I bought 
        (<a href="http://teachtecnnc.com">www.teachtechnc.com</a>), this will make navigation significantly easier. The "Home" and "About" 
        sections of the website are fairly simple, and both are served up directly from the frontend. The curriculum database is probably
        the most technically complex. The frontend is in charge of making sure selections are made correctly (i.e. you select at least one subject
        or topic). This information is then send to the backend server, which pulls data from Google Firebase and does all the filtering necessary. 
        This means that the frontend just has to display the information passed by the backend, rather than doing additional filtering of its own. 
        However, if you want to filter the data after it has already been passed to the frontend (using the "filter resources" button), that will
        be done in the frontend for faster results. The "student curriculum partners" section pulls data from both the Duke Directory API and 
        Firebase. The names and email addresses displayed when viewing all student partners is pulled from the API and, if you click on a 
        student partner, the short biographical information is pulled from Firebase. The "profile" section relies on OAuth to verify
        a user. Once verified, the user can add their own resources to the curriculum database. This is all done through the backend connecting with
        Firebase, but the verification for whether a correct value was entered is done in the frontend, so as to decrease wait times. And finally, if 
        the user is recognized as an administrator, then they are able to view all the user logs in the profile section.

            <h4><a href="https://api-catalog.oit.duke.edu/apis/2">Duke Directory API</a></h4>
            <p>
                The Duke Directory API "provides JSON streams of data which show directory information for faculty, students, and staff. 
                Directory information includes name, DUID, NetID, campus address and phone, job title, affiliation, and department." However,
                as of right now, I only needed a limited amount of that data so, for each call to the API, I filtered out all the unnecessary data
                before passing it back to the frontend.

            <h4><a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/database">Firebase Realtime Database</a></h4>
            <p>
                In order to store most of the information that the application runs on, I used the Google's Firebase Realtime
                Database.

            <p>
                In order to verify users and have them sign in, I used Google's Cloud Credentials.

            <p>
                Much of the frontend design of the website was put together using Bootstrap Vue components.

            <h4><a href="https://vue-multiselect.js.org/">Vue Multiselect</a></h4>
            <p>
                In order to generate a more visually pleasing dropdown of options, I used Vue Multiselect.

                This was used as the font for the main title of the application.

            <h4>Data in Curriculum Database</h4>
            <p>
                All the data in the curriculum database was either 1) curated by me, 2) created by me for example purposes, or
                3) added by some other user of the site. In the future, curating this further will be a substantial focus.
