    <h1>Progress Report 1</h1>

    <h2>Video Demo</h2>

    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>
        In the "student curriculum partners" section of the website, the data will be coming from two different sources:
        the Duke Directory API and a database that I will be setting up using Google Firebase. The contact information 
        comes from the Duke API and the biography information (which I haven't yet added) will be set up in Google Firebase.
        <br>
        In the "curriculum databse" section, that will all be information that will be put together manually (for another class). 
        I have input some data into Firebase for this, but unfortunately the process is fairly time-consuming as none of it can 
        be accessed from some other API, nor can it be easily webscraped. I do plan on adding a functionality to the website for 
        admin users that would allow them to easily add new resources. 
        <br>
        For a sample look at what some of the actual JSON data looks like, you can visit the 
        <a href="https://stormy-caverns-94672.herokuapp.com/">homepage</a> (of sorts) for my Heroku server, which returns information 
        from the Duke Directory API. 
    </p>

    <h2>Progress</h2>
    <p>
        My original goal for the second week was to create components for different parts that will come up from a database search, and set 
        up the pages so that a list of different resources are displayed. I was able to accomplish both of these goals. I did a lot of work
        on setting up the database this week, but I am planning to change it once again as I was not happy with the organization and 
        how difficult adding new resources was. 
    </p>

    <h2>Concerns</h2>
    <p>
        I am having a few technical concerns. When using Vue Router for the production version, I am having an issue where the 
        homepage doesn't show up when you first click on the website link. I have also been having difficulties with my ESLINT files,
        so I am working on getting those to properly function as well. And, as I mentioned last time, this project in general is taking 
        more time than anticipated. 
    </p>

    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <p>
        I have learned a fair bit about Firebase and how to create a robust and fast NoSQL database. 
    </p>

    <h2>Plan</h2>
    <p>
        My plan for the next week includes a lot of different things. My first priority is to refactor the database and associated 
        code so that it is simpler to add new resources. Then I plan on doing squashing the bugs with the Vue router stuff and the ESLINT 
        files. A small goal is to add in the student biography information and team pictures. My big goal is to work on user authentication,
        so that I can build out the different features that each type of user will have access to. 
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Overall, I still feel good about this project but at times, it does seem like a bit more than I can chew. Hopefully, once I work through
        some of the technical problems, these feelings will subside. It's definitely feasible - it just may take a little more time than I anticipated.
