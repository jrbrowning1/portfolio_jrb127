    <h1>Progress Report 1</h1>

    <h2>Video Demo</h2>
    <a href="https://duke.box.com/v/jonathan-progress-report-1">Click here for a video demonstration of a few parts of my application</a>
    
    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>
        In the "student curriculum partners" section of the website, the data will be coming from two different sources:
        the Duke Directory API and a database that I will be setting up using Google Firebase. The contact information 
        comes from the Duke API and the biography information (which I haven't yet added) will be set up in Google Firebase.
        In the "curriculum databse" section, that will all be information that will be put together manually (for another class). 
        As of right now, there is no API that would provide the information that I need, nor do I plan on webscraping. However,
        I haven't ruled out web scraping entirely as it might be useful to do so for the different educational standards I plan to 
        use. For a sample look at what some of the actual JSON data looks like, you can visit the 
        <a href="https://stormy-caverns-94672.herokuapp.com/">homepage</a> (of sorts) for my Heroku server, which returns information 
        from the Duke Directory API. 
    </p>

    <h2>Progress</h2>
    <p>
        My original goal for the first check was to build out the frontend framework of my site and for the most part, I have
        accomplished that. However, my original plan didn't entail setting up OAuth - I was going to do that myself so I am slightly
        behind on the signup and login page section of my plan. However, once I go back through the example from class, it should be (hopefully)
        relatively simple to add in these sections. Another one of my goals was to experiment with the Firebase database, and I have done that.
        Right now I just have some simple data there (which can be seen in the video), but I have tested to see if it would properly run if 
        used with my server backend, and it did. I haven't yet tried to store user input in the database, so that will be one of my next
        goals.
    </p>

    <h2>Concerns</h2>
    <p>
        I haven't found implementing any of the features to be particuarly concerning, but I do realize now that this project may take 
        more technical debugging than I anticipated. Perhaps I have been lucky throughout the semester, but most things have worked
        the first time (when I'm not overlooking a simply typo), but I had to spend quite a bit of time working with heroku to get 
        it to work this time. 
    </p>

    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <p>
        All of the Vue apps that we have made so far are single page apps, without any reason to navigate to other pages. However,
        my final project website requires multiple different pages. I could have implemented this using v-ifs and the like but,
        as this is a website I intend to actually publish publically, I wanted it to have actual different paths. So, I looked into vue router
        for a while, and ended up figuring out how to use that. However, that did set me back a little, as I implemented after I had 
        already started working on the navigation without it. 
    </p>

    <h2>Plan</h2>
    <p>
        My plan for the next progress check remains much the same as my original plan - that is build out the details of the 
        student partner search and add data to the database so that I can work on the curriculum database being able to actually search 
        new things. The TA's feedback didn't offer a whole lot for me to add on, except to make sure that I have administrator role 
        in addition to any other user types I create. However, I don't anticipate adding that part yet.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Overall, I still feel good about this project but at times, it does seem like a bit more than I can chew. Hopefully, once I work through
        some of the technical problems that have arisen from using technology that I hadn't before (such as Firebase), these feelings will subside. 
        It's definitely feasible - it just may take a little more time than I anticipated, but I probably should have expected that.
